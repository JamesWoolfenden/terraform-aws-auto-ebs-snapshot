# terraform-aws-ebssnap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-ebssnap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-ebssnap) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-ebssnap.svg)](https://github.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-ebssnap/releases/latest)

A Terraform module to automate the taking of backup snapshots.

---

This project uses the "build-harness" a modified version of the project ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) from Cloudposse. Sweet indeed.

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

``` HCL
module "ebsnapshot" {
  source          = "github.com/jameswoolfenden/terraform-aws-ebssnap"
  common_tags     = "${var.common_tags}"
  snapshot_name   = "${local.snapshot_name}"
  cron_expression = "${var.cron_expression}"
  regions         = "${var.regions}"
}
```

Creates a lambda and cloudwatch event to look for any instances that have the specfied tag and then takes a snapshot of that volume.
This is a heavily modified version of this module: <https://github.com/kgorskowski/ebs_bckup>

Set up your Terraform tf vars file to look something like:

``` HCL
common_tags = {
    application = "terraform"
    module      = "auto-ebs-snapshot"
    environment = "develop"
}

EC2_INSTANCE_TAG = "Backup"
RETENTION_DAYS   = 10
cron_expression  = "45 1 * * ? *"
regions          = ["eu-west-1","eu-west-2","eu-west-3"]
```
